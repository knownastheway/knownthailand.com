        <em>The gospel is that God himself has come to rescue and restore all things in and through the work of Jesus Christ for His Glory.</em>

        </p>
<p>
        Jesus Christ is the gospel or good news that we celebrate. According to 1 Cor 15, Paul reminds the church of Corinth that Christ died, was buried, and rose on the third day, all according to the scriptures for our sins. The gospel or “good news” of Jesus is made know by His birth, sinless
        <strong>life</strong>, obedient
        <strong>death</strong>, historical
        <strong>resurrection</strong> and miraculous ascension with the promise that He will
        <strong>return</strong> one day.

            <strong>Our response to the Gospel:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>This is “good news”, but doesn’t makes sense for our lives if it is not put into the bigger story of Gods story</p>

        <h3>The Gospel of Jesus Christ</h3>
        <p>Gods’ story begins with Him being all sufficient within His triune self. God then created everything perfect, and in this <strong>creation</strong> He created man to be dependent on and in a perfect relationship with Himself (Gen 1). Man rebelled against God, and through man’s sin, fractured that relationship and all of creation (Gen 3). </p> <p>Because of the <strong>fall</strong>, man and all of creation was corrupted and could no longer live in the presence of a holy God. God separates Himself from man, and man continues to do more evil and spiral out of control apart from God (Gen 3-8). </p> <p>God later makes a promise with man (Gen 15) and the entire OT narrative looks forward to the <strong>rescuer</strong>, the One who will save man from his sins, and <strong>restore</strong> the relationship between God and man. God humbles Himself and takes on flesh in Jesus Christ (John 1). Fully God and fully human, Jesus is born of a virgin by the power of the Holy Spirit (Matt 1:18), and lives a sinless life (Heb 4:14-16), goes to the cross, and pays for the sins of man by pouring Himself out as an sacrificial offering, pleasing to God (Isa 53:10). </p> <p>The <strong>death</strong> of Jesus pays for the sin of our lives, and by His <strong>resurrection</strong> we are <strong>rescued</strong> back to God and given a <strong>new life</strong>. His <strong>death</strong> satisfies the demands of God's holy justice, the death for our sin. The <strong>new life</strong> of Christ is given to man by the power of the Holy Spirit for those who believe and have faith in Jesus Christ as their Savior (Col 1:21-23). </p> <p>Jesus, after rising from the dead, appeared on earth and to more than 500 people. He then ascended to heaven and now sits at the right hand of the Father, interceding for His children. The Holy Spirit was sent to the world and now dwells inside of the family of God (the church), and continues to redeem the family of God until the mission of God is finished. </p> <p>One day Jesus Christ will <strong>return</strong> to earth, everyone who has ever lived will be judged justly, and all of God’s family and creation will have a fully restored relationship with Himself (Rev 21). Those who are not God’s people will spend an eternity separated from God. </p> <p>The proper response to the gospel is faith in the person and work of Jesus Christ, a faith that is naturally accompanied by repentance from sin. Biblical repentance is characterized by a changed life, and kingdom service or works evidences saving faith.  If one has truly believed in Jesus as their savior, their heart will be willing to follow Christ and His commands over their life. This response to the gospel is rooted and grounded in the free and unconditional election of God for His own pleasure and glory. This gospel of grace is to be sincerely told to all people in all nations.</p><br>
