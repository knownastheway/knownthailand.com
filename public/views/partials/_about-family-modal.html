        <em>We are the children of God who live and care for each other as a family.</em>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>

        <p>God created all people for Himself and His glory. In all time God has consistently called and set apart a family-an earthly family-who would live in such a way that the world would know what He is like. Jesus said that those who live in His ways and obey His commands are truly His family. Through Jesus we believe we are the children of God who live as one family. As family we see that it is commanded to personally care for the needs of one another and others - both physically and spiritually. We love God, love each other and love others as Christ has loved us. This love that we have shows the world that we are followers of Jesus. In love we disciple, care for and hold each other accountable to this life together. We do this through regular gatherings and consistent involvement in each others lives. Just like any family, we are not perfect, but by God’s grace we are empowered to live and love one another as Gods family. (Genesis 12:1-3; Matt 12: 49-50, John 1:12-13; Romans 12:10-16, 2 Cor 6:18, Eph 3:14-19, 1 Tim 5:1-7)</p>

                <strong style="text-decoration:underline">Family of Worshipers</strong>- We are worshipers of Jesus who strive to follow Jesus and obey His commands out of a love for Him. What you see as most valuable in your life is what you will devote your life to and worship. All people worship, the only difference is what the object of our affections are directed towards. God calls His family to worship Him. We do this by directing our affections, love, time, energy and self towards Him. In worship we express our gratitude and affections of love directed towards God in and from all things. Worship is the right response to the goodness of God. This response is love. God calls His family to Love Him and love one another. If we are doing these two things, we are following all the commands of God according to scripture. A true love for God naturally overflows to others around us no matter if they are friend or enemy. As Gods family we desire to live a life of worship together and invite others to experience the way to a loving relationship with Jesus. (Matt 22: 36-40)</li>

                <strong style="text-decoration:underline">Family of Disciples</strong>- Jesus called others to follow His ways, to be his disciples and live in obedience to all that God commands. He then sent these disciples out to make new disciples. We believe we are also called to be followers of Jesus who strive to obey all the commands of Jesus out of love, and teach others to obey the commands of Jesus out of love according to the scriptures. This includes our personal time with God, with one another, as well as equipping provided by spiritual leadership. (Luke 2:52; Matthew 28:18-20; Ephesians 4:11-13; 2 Timothy 2:2) All those who follow Jesus are called to serve just as Jesus did. For us this means joyful submission to God, leadership and to each other, as we serve whomever God brings into our lives. We do this by meeting the needs of others both spiritually and physically. Jesus came so that all people, places and things could be restored to a right relationship with God. He worked, ate and interacted among the people; living in such a way that those around Him could see and experience what God was truly like. In the same way, we believe we are disciples sent into our world to restore all things to the Father through Jesus, and called to live in such a way that others would also experience what God is truly like. We live this out as God’s family of disciples placed in cities around the world. (Matthew 20:25-28; 25:31-46; John 1:14; 13:1-17; 20:21; Colossians 1:19; 2 Corinthians 5-18-20; Philippians 2:5-11; 1 Peter 2:16)</li>
